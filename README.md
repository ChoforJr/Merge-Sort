# Merge-Sort
A significant part of computer science is dedicated to sorting data. An algorithm which uses the ‘divide and conquer’ approach of recursion is able to reduce a sorting problem to smaller and smaller sub-problems.  Merge sort is one such sorting algorithm, and can be much faster than other algorithms such as bubble sort on the right data sets.
